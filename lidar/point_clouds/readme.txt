In order to reduce the size of the repository, the ~3GB of .PCD files 
captured in initial testing have been moved to physical storage. 

There should be 3 copies (with various backup dates):
1. On the LiDAR's Raspberry Pi SSD (most up-to-date),
2. On a thumb drive in the AEGIS cabinet (second-best), and
3. On Zach's personal computer (last resort).

As scans are taken, they should be stored locally, not on the remote repo.
