In order to reduce the size of the repository, the ~3GB of .PCD files 
captured in initial testing have been moved to physical storage. 

There should be 3 copies (with various backup dates):
1. On the LiDAR's Raspberry Pi SSD (most up-to-date),
2. On a thumb drive in the AEGIS cabinet (second-best), and
3. On Zach's personal computer (last resort).

As scans are taken, they may be pushed to GitHub but the total size of
all scan data should not exceed 400 MB, with no scan exceeding 75 MB.
